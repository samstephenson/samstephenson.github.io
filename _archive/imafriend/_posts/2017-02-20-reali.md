Reali is an end-to-end home buying & selling app. With it, users can find their dream home, schedule app-guided open houses, get pre-approved, place offers on a home and complete deals—all from their iPhone.

I was tasked with designing the Reali experience for Android. Carrying the Reali experience from iOS forward whilst adapting to Android-specific design patterns.

The iOS design already leaned heavily on Android's Material Design principles, but a myriad of small details—grids, typography, buttons, input components etc., were adjusted to give a native feeling experience for Android devices.

In all around 200 screens had to be redrawn, assets exported and specs built out for developers.
