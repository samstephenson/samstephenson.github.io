## The brief
**Design a new kind of photo-printer.** Semi-portable, for a millenial audience. That was the brief set to the team at NewDeal.

The big question – *why on earth would anyone print photos nowadays?* was the driver for our research. Digital photo storage has become so prevalent it's initally hard to see much value in the printed photo, but through much research and debate we arrived at a few keys 'buckets' for reasons to print photos… *photos as keepsakes*, *photos as communication*, and *photos as creative expression*.

With this headings in place, research morphed into wide, fast-paced generating of ideas. Between industrial and experience design teams we generated dozens of potential avenues to follow.

From this, with client feedback, we narrowed to eight, and then three, routes to run with.

## Photos as communication – prototyping the digital experience

The Photos as communication route leaned heavily on digital experience, with a photo messaging app connected to your friends and delivering photos through your printer. I was tasked with designing the app's experience and creating a prototype to sell the idea to the client.

I started with the simplest of sketches and wireframes – figuring out the user journeys and deciding what was important.

#####  This approach used friends' avatars as individual shutter buttons. Some quick user testing proved this to be terrible for usability. People didn't recognise the faces as buttons and were paralyzed at the first step!

##### A more familiar photo-messaging flow proved much more successful in testing.

## Interactive prototypes

Working in Flinto, I hacked together a prototype for people to play with.

With <a href="http://monkeychau.com/" alt="Timmy Chau">Timmy Chau's</a> help and visual deisgn chops, we tweaked this and made a first pass at visual design. Building a more high-fidelity prototype to present to the client.
