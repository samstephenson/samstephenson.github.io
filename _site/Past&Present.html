<h3 id="the-brief">The Brief:</h3>
<p>Create a publication for the Royal Institute of Philosophy, titled ‘Past &amp; Present’, using provided lecture transcripts, biographies and quotes. The publication should embody the Institute’s message, ‘philosophy for everyone’, making the subject accessible and engaging to a wide audience beyond academia.</p>

<h3 id="solution-capture-the-spirit-of-a-live-event">Solution: Capture the spirit of a live event</h3>
<p>The content comprises a series of lecture transcripts from a single event. Encapsulate the spirit of this event within the design of the publication, making readers feel as if they were in the room with the speaker, reliving the event for themselves.</p>

<p>The book is printed monochrome in a rich blue/purple, accompanied by stuck-in 6x4 photo prints of the event. It is set in Baskerville and Akzidenz Grotesk – a juxtaposition of old and new to reflect the Past &amp; Present theme.</p>

<p>Publication is split into two sections: lecture transcripts and biographies – signified by a change in paper stock.</p>
