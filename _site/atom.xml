   <title>An iOS app for resolving who owes what</title>
   <link href="http://samstephenson.github.io/work/MoneyApp.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping track of who-owes-who-what&lt;/strong&gt; situations is difficult. Paying bills among housemates, settling up for dinner, or borrowing cash from a friend – it’s easy to lose track of things or get in a muddle over money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current solutions – spreadsheets, IOU notes, group noticeboards etc., tend to be one-sided, relying on the diligence and calculations of one individual. Where money is involved we want certainty we’re being treated fairly. A digital ‘middle man’ service could monitor these exchanges with transparency, mitigating the tensions that usually come with borrowing money. An open and accurate record would remove disputes or inaccuracies over who owes what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-brief&quot;&gt;The Brief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design a digital product to help people manage group payments and keep track of money owed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow lending money between friends and groups to be a totally relaxed and good-natured event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends should feel happier buying things for each other, helping each other out financially.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Empower a person to take responsibility for a bill or payment without worry – knowing they’ll be reimbursed quickly and fully.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember: we’re sharing money among friends, not legally binding client invoices. Using the product should be a quick, friendly gesture. An expression of trust. Definitely not a chore!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-research&quot;&gt;User research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/user-research.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Money app user survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;initial-survey&quot;&gt;Initial survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the problem, I put out a survey among 100 or so fellow students, staff and tutors — asking for their stories, issues and experiences of borrowing money or splitting payments among friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read a copy of the survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/idsokfkels8f9tl/questionnaire%20single.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 80 came back. Most were full of useful insights, figures and anecdotes as well as many common themes and pain points. These could be grouped into independent scenarios where issues arose and the product might intervene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–2–1 transactions: ‘I owe you £x for y’, your round at the pub, picking up the bill for a friend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One-off, group events: splitting one payment among multiple people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recurring, group-based events: house bills, rotas,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Group payment, unequal split: splitting a restaurant bill, each person paying a different amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long term, large-scale debts: “I owe my family thousands”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empathy-maps&quot;&gt;Empathy maps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/empathy-map-web.png&quot; alt=&quot;Money app empathy maps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I picked out potential user groups from the research and did an empathy mapping exercise for each. Helping to understand users’ different points of view, identify pain points, and think about how I might solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personas&quot;&gt;Personas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/personas.png&quot; alt=&quot;User personas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empathy maps were developed further into personas. Specific people, potential users of the product — representative of our audience, whose problems encapsulated the key issues surfaced through user research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this, I’m able to keep specific people in mind when designing the product. If I’ve successfully solved their problems, theory says I’ll have covered most issues for all of my users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a closer look at the personas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8olqlkxrmrtwztj/Personas.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-journeys&quot;&gt;User Journeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then mapped out the personas’ individual tasks – all the steps they’d take to solve their problem and how the app would fit into that. This all helped pin down the range of functions the product would need to fulfil and gave a guide for the information architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketching&quot;&gt;Sketching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;messaging-pattern&quot;&gt;Messaging pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided on a messaging style architecture for the product. Here’s why:
- People owing money to each other is always essentially a one-to-one relationship. Even if there’s a big payment split among many people, debts will always boil down to X-owes-Y £n.
- A sequence of ‘I paid for this, she paid for that’ events would naturally start to resemble a conversation, a back and forth dialogue between two people. 
- On your phone, one-to-one relationships with friends almost all live inside messaging apps. 
- The ‘messaging-conversation model’ is well understood by the average smartphone user. Less to learn for first-time users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-prototypes&quot;&gt;Initial prototypes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-one-to-one-event&quot;&gt;New one-to-one event&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/flow-new-event-phone.gif&quot; alt=&quot;adding a new one-to-one event&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack went shopping and picked up some cleaning stuff for my room. I owe him £1.25&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-event-in-group&quot;&gt;New event in group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/flow-new-group-event.gif&quot; alt=&quot;adding a bill to a group&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jackie has been shopping for a house dinner in ASDA. She wants to split the cost among all housemates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;handling-reminders&quot;&gt;Handling reminders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key findings from research was that most of the tension and awkwardness in relationships came from having to chase friends up or deal with someone who’d forgotten to pay you back. Nobody likes to have to ask a friend for money — you feel like you’re showing a lack of trust, they feel guilty for letting a friend down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An app would be ideally placed to deal with this — acting as a neutral ‘middle man’ to deal with chasing up and asking for money in a much less personal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hello-debtbot&quot;&gt;Hello, DebtBot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not personify this ‘middle man’ character in the product? A ‘dumb AI’ of sorts, to help you keep on top of your debts to friends and ensure you pay up well before any feelings turn sour. I’ve called it DebtBot for now… it’ll have a proper name soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/debtbot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Debtbot implemented in-app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first explored the idea of DebtBot having its own home within the app. A separate screen you’d visit for notifications and reminders around paying your friends. On reflection however, and after trying the idea out on friends, it felt odd having such reminders separate from the context of the relationship it referred to. Instead, I moved it inline with each relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/sidekicks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Debtbot – your financial sidekick&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DebtBot should act like a trusty sidekick, or organised personal assistant. It’s got your back – keeping on top of debts, and will chase after friends that have forgotten to pay you back. Its trustworthy, amiable personality should come across in its tone of voice, both visually and when it’s speaking to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts-on-the-visual-language&quot;&gt;Thoughts on the visual language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-one-person-owes-another-money&quot;&gt;When one person owes another money…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money-app/doodles-web.png&quot; alt=&quot;money-owed dynamics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a bond between them – it’s a symbol of trust and friendship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is tension (potential energy?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s an inequality that wants to be resolved Starts out good-willed – doing someone a favour (should be encouraged)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This sense of balance, energy and motion might play with these dynamics through visuals and animation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is far from done, so here’s what I need to tackle next…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-a-visual-identity&quot;&gt;Developing a visual identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pin down a distinctive voice for the product and begin to work into the product and marketing material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;map-out-all-necessary-user-flows&quot;&gt;Map out all necessary user flows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a more complete map of all the functionality that needs to exist in the product – design the stuff that’s missing and tie it together into prototypes for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-testing&quot;&gt;User testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organise a testing day and recruit participants to test user flows. Document the event. Try and do a few of these before year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Past & Present publication</title>
   <link href="http://samstephenson.github.io/work/Past-and-Present.html"/>
   <updated>2016-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://samstephenson.github.io/work/Past-and-Present</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-brief&quot;&gt;The Brief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an event publication for the Royal Institute of Philosophy’s Past &amp;amp; Present series, using the provided lecture transcripts, biographies and quotes. 
The publication should embody the Institute’s message, ‘philosophy for everyone’, making the subject accessible and engaging to a wide audience beyond academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capture the spirit of a live event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content provided is a series of lecture transcripts. I wanted to encapsulate the experience of those live lectures within the design of the publication – making readers feel as if they were in the room with the speaker, reliving the event for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;craft&quot;&gt;Craft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is printed in a single, rich cobalt ink, designed to feel prestigious and envelope the reader in the words of the lecturers. The type is set in Baskerville and Akzidenz Grotesk – a juxtaposition of old England and new modernism to reflect the Past &amp;amp; Present theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publication is split into two sections: lecture transcripts and biographies – signified by a change in paper stock.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Branding Bitcoin for the developing world</title>
   <link href="http://samstephenson.github.io/work/Bitcoin.html"/>
   <updated>2016-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://samstephenson.github.io/work/Bitcoin</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is a new way of doing money – and as a currency it is slowly maturing. But fundamentally it is a system born in the gloomy world of hacker forums, built on complex cryptography beyond the comprehension of most ordinary folk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve mainstream success, Bitcoin must learn to speak human, make itself accessible and useful to ordinary people and grow up and out from its hacker roots. Once it does, it has the potential to revolutionise the world of finance and affect the lives of billions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-will-benefit-most&quot;&gt;Who will benefit most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/developed-land.png&quot; alt=&quot;Where can bitcoin make a difference?&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the developed world, over 95% of us own a bank account, and are comfortable with that. For us, I’m not yet sure there’s a compelling case for adopting Bitcoin. In the developing world however, it’s a different story. Around 50% of the world doesn’t have a bank account – for them Bitcoin could actually be an opportunity – to leapfrog the West and lead the world with the future of currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;money--poverty&quot;&gt;Money &amp;amp; poverty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, nearly half the world’s population still lives below the poverty line on less than $2.50 a day. In this environment economies are mostly cash-based and informal. There is no accountability, allowing exploitation of the poor to run rife whilst governments and financial powers are corrupt. This all serves to create an unstable national currency and starves the poorest of the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin can help solve this. Its democratic and decentralised nature unties people from corruption and can help them take control of their finances. Money becomes a tool for self-improvement, not a weight to shackle you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing&quot;&gt;Introducing…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/bitcoin-banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin: you empowered&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;values&quot;&gt;Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe&lt;/strong&gt;: Bitcoin stays with you; wherever you and your phone may go. Your money is locked down so only you may access it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliable&lt;/strong&gt;: Free from the influence of corruption and unstable cash economies, Bitcoin is a reliable foundation to put your faith in and build a future from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible&lt;/strong&gt;:
With no barrier to entry the system is simple and user friendly. The network of CoinAgents means it’s never far to withdraw and deposit cash.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic&lt;/strong&gt;:
As a decentralised currency, the future of Bitcoin is dictated by the people that use it – an entire government holds no more influence than any individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowering&lt;/strong&gt;:
Bitcoin’s technology opens up possibilities impossible for a cash economy. With Bitcoin, there are no horizons – it operates on an international scale not bound by borders or city limits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human&lt;/strong&gt;:
Bitcoin transactions are person to person – it’s just you, and the one receiving your money, with no faceless organisation lurking in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bitcoin-coinagents&quot;&gt;Bitcoin CoinAgents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/shopfront.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin CoinAgent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap between current cash economies and new digital currency, a network of ‘CoinAgents’ would allow people to easily exchange their cash for Bitcoin. Customers simply hand over cash and receive the equivalent Bitcoin, via SMS or a printed voucher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merchant-app&quot;&gt;Merchant app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This smartphone app allows CoinAgents to perform and track exchanges quickly and securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://marvelapp.com/19fa5f7?emb=1&quot; width=&quot;390&quot; height=&quot;755&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onboarding&quot;&gt;Onboarding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/leaflet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Introduction to Bitcoin handout&quot; class=&quot;wide&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To introduce people to the potential of Bitcoin, I designed a leaflet to be handed out at points-of-sale and other touchpoints. The language is crafted to quickly clarify the benefits of digital currency and make signing up as easy as possible. Informal copy, newsprint paper and hand-drawn illustrations give it a helpful, approachable feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;environmental-application&quot;&gt;Environmental Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branding is spread throughout populated areas using everyday objects coloured with the same distinctive yellow. The message and objects are all metaphors for Bitcoin’s key values and all have real uses beyond advertising so they can permeate the environment over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special messages are tailored towards small businesses. The printed mats, for example, serve as a metaphor for people literally building their business upon Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/environmental1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin environmental marketing&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/environmental2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin environmental marketing&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/environmental3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin environmental marketing&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/environmental4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin environmental marketing&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin/environmental5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin environmental marketing&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Grandma’s company, Jack Beck, has been a popular provider of art courses and holidays for over 15 years. From their picturesque location in the Yorkshire Dales, they host multi-day courses taught by leading British artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I redesigned their site back in 2011. It’s a Wordpress site adapted from an existing theme, designed to showcase the courses on offer and the stunning location, as well as making booking clear and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 years later, feedback from users is still great. Most importantly, the courses are booked up each year within days of their announcement. Grandma’s still happy with it and, with the documentation I created to go with the site, can update it herself each year with minimal input from me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amber Business is a small business consultancy and financial directors based in the South West of England. They asked for a new website to better communicate what they do to prospective customers, and to drive new enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Michael, the owner, we decided on a design which talks the user through his proposition. Communicating the value he could provide whilst retaining a healthy dose of his personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the design decided, I built the site on top of an existing single-page Wordpress theme, heavily customised to fit the design.&lt;/p&gt;
