<p>Last night for dinner I had fried vegetables - specifically potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach. It was satisfying, but only fairly tasty. I think perhaps a larger dose of seasoning and maybe some fresh green beans would have been helpful. With that I drank tea. I had porridge for breakfast.</p>
