			<p><strong>Keeping track of who-owes-who-what</strong> situations is difficult. Paying bills among housemates, settling up for dinner, or borrowing cash from a friend – it’s easy to lose track of things or get in a muddle over money.</p>

<p>Current solutions – spreadsheets, IOU notes, group noticeboards etc., tend to be one-sided, relying on the diligence and calculations of one individual. Where our money is involved we want certainty we’re being treated fairly. A digital ‘middle man’ service could monitor these exchanges with transparency, mitigating the tensions that usually come with borrowing money. An open and accurate record would remove disputes or inaccuracies over who owes what.</p>

<h2 id="the-brief">The Brief</h2>
<p>Design a digital product to help people manage group payments and keep track of money owed.</p>

<p>The product should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow lending money between friends and groups to be a totally relaxed and good-natured event.</li>
  <li>Friends should feel happier buying things for each other, helping each other out financially.</li>
  <li>Empower a person to take responsibility for a bill or payment without worry – knowing they’ll be reimbursed quickly and fully.</li>
  <li>Remember: we’re sharing money among friends, not legally binding client invoices. Using the product should be a quick, friendly gesture. An expression of trust. Definitely not a chore!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-research">User research</h2>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/user-research.jpg" alt="Money app user survey" /></p>

<h3 id="initial-survey">Initial survey</h3>
<p>To better understand the problem, I put out a survey among 100 or so fellow students, staff and tutors — asking for their stories, issues and experiences of borrowing money or splitting payments among friends.</p>

<p>Read a copy of the survey <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/idsokfkels8f9tl/questionnaire%20single.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Around 80 came back. Most were full of useful insights, figures and anecdotes as well as many common themes and pain points. These could be grouped into independent scenarios where issues arose and the product might intervene:
- 1–2–1 transactions: ‘I owe you £x for y’, your round at the pub, picking up the bill for a friend
- One-off, group events: Splitting one payment among multiple people.
- Recurring, group-based events: House bills, rotas Group payment, unequal split: splitting a restaurant bill, each person paying a different amount
- Long term, large-scale debts: “I owe my family thousands”</p>

<h3 id="empathy-maps">Empathy maps</h3>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/empathy-map-web.png" alt="Money app empathy maps" /></p>

<p>Moving on, I picked out potential user groups from the research and did an empathy mapping exercise for each. Helping to understand users’ different points of view, identify pain points, and think about how I might solve them.</p>

<p>Take a look at a few [link]</p>

<h3 id="personas">Personas</h3>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/personas.png" alt="User personas" /></p>

<p>The empathy maps were developed further into personas. Specific people, potential users of the product — representative of our audience, whose problems encapsulated the key issues surfaced through user research.</p>

<p>Doing this, I’m able to keep specific people in mind when designing the product. If I’ve successfully solved their problems, theory says I’ll have covered most issues for all of my users.</p>

<p>Explore my personas <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8olqlkxrmrtwztj/Personas.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="user-journeys">User Journeys</h3>
<p>I then mapped out the personas’ individual tasks – all the steps they’d take to solve their problem and how the app would fit into that. This all helped pin down the range of functions the product would need to fulfil and gave a guide for the information architecture.</p>

<h2 id="sketching">Sketching</h2>

<h3 id="messaging-pattern">Messaging pattern</h3>
<p>I decided on a messaging style architecture for the product. Here’s why:
- People owing money to each other is always essentially a one-to-one relationship. Even if there’s a big payment split among many people, debts will always boil down to X-owes-Y £n.
- A sequence of ‘I paid for this, she paid for that’ events would naturally start to resemble a conversation, a back and forth dialog between two people. 
- On your phone, one-to-one relationships with friends almost all live inside messaging apps. 
- The ‘messaging-conversation model’ is well understood by the average smartphone user. Less to learn for first-time users.</p>

<h3 id="new-one-to-one-event">New one-to-one event</h3>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/flow-new-event-phone.gif" alt="adding a new one-to-one event" /></p>

<p><em>Jack went shopping and picked up some cleaning stuff for my room. I owe him £1.25</em>.</p>

<h3 id="new-event-in-group">New event in group</h3>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/flow-new-group-event.gif" alt="adding a bill to a group" /></p>

<p><em>Jackie has been shopping for a house dinner in ASDA. She wants to split the cost among all housemates</em>.</p>

<h2 id="handling-reminders">Handling reminders</h2>
<p>One of the key findings from research was that most of the tension and awkwardness in relationships came from having to chase friends up or deal with someone who’d forgotten to pay you back. Nobody likes to have to ask a friend for money — you feel like you’re showing a lack of trust, they feel guilty for letting a friend down.</p>

<p>An app would be ideally placed to deal with this — acting as a neutral ‘middle man’ to deal with chasing up and asking for money in a much less personal way.</p>

<h3 id="hello-debtbot">Hello, DebtBot</h3>

<p>So why not personify this ‘middle man’ character in the product? A ‘dumb AI’ of sorts, to help you keep on top of your debts to friends and ensure you pay up well before any feelings turn sour. I’ve called it DebtBot for now… it’ll have a proper name soon enough.</p>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/debtbot.png" alt="Debtbot implemented in-app" /></p>

<p>I first explored the idea of DebtBot having its own home within the app. A separate screen you’d visit for notifications and reminders around paying your friends. On reflection however, and after trying the idea out on friends, it felt odd having such reminders separate from the context of the relationship it referred to. Instead, I moved it inline with each relationship.</p>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/sidekicks.jpg" alt="Debtbot – your financial sidekick" /></p>

<p>DebtBot should act like a trusty sidekick, or organised personal assistant. It’s got your back – keeping on top of debts, and will chase after friends that have forgotten to pay you back. Its trustworthy, amiable personality should come across in its tone of voice, both visually and when it’s speaking to you.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-the-visual-language">Thoughts on the visual language</h2>

<h3 id="when-one-person-owes-another-money">When one person owes another money…</h3>

<p><img src="/images/money-app/doodles-web.png" alt="money-owed dynamics" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a bond between them – it’s a symbol of trust and friendship</li>
  <li>There is tension (potential energy?)</li>
  <li>There’s an inequality that wants to be resolved Starts out good-willed – doing someone a favour (should be encouraged)</li>
  <li>This sense of balance, energy and motion might play with these dynamics through visuals and animation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>This project is far from done, so here’s what I need to tackle next…</p>

<h3 id="developing-a-visual-identity">Developing a visual identity</h3>
<p>Pin down a distinctive voice for the product and begin to work into the product and marketing material.</p>

<h3 id="map-out-all-necessary-user-flows">Map out all necessary user flows</h3>
<p>Make a more complete map of all the functionality that needs to exist in the product – design the stuff that’s missing and tie it together into prototypes for testing.</p>

<h3 id="user-testing">User testing</h3>
<p>Organise a testing day and recruit participants to test user flows. Document the event. Try and do a few of these before year-end.</p>
