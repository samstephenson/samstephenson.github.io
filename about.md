I’m Sam Stephenson, a freelance designer and student at Falmouth University. I study graphic design, but have long held an affinity with web and digital products. I have a passion for ideas-driven design: crafting experiences with empathy and respect for human behaviour. Affecting lives for the better.

I’ll be graduating in June this year, and am seeking internships with start-ups and digital agencies in London or San Francisco.

When not working, I’m likely to be surfing, kayaking or exploring the outdoors, and encouraging others to do so. I represented the UK in freestyle kayaking (bronze medallist 2012 European Championships) and am the Head Coach at Falmouth Student Kayak Club.

### Experience
See my résumé for a more comprehensive list.

#### Placement at ASHA, a branding agency (August–September 2015)
Actively contributed to naming, brand strategy and logo development in the lead up to first-stage client presentation for ChangeGrowLive. Designed a custom icon set for use in environmental graphics and branding material. Work placement extended at request of ASHA.

#### OgilvyChange Summer School (August 2015)
OgilvyChange are a specialist behaviour-change division of the Ogilvy & Mather advertising group. I was the only designer to secure a place on their summer school. With a small team of psychology graduates, I presented ideas and behavioural ‘nudges’ to encourage the recycling of clothes in the home and in-store . I designed the presentation which was forwarded to a national charity for potential implementation.

#### Freelance web & graphic designer (2009–present)
Designed a consistent visual identity for the Hurley Classic, one of the UK’s largest whitewater kayaking events. Created the logo, posters, programmes, banners, Facebook ads, web graphics, trophies and t-shirts for this international event. 
Designed, built and maintained Wordpress sites for Jack Beck, Amber Business and Norma Stephenson with documentation for each.
