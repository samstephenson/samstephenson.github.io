**I’m Sam Stephenson**, a freelance designer and student at Falmouth University. I study graphic design, but have long held an affinity with web and digital products. I have a passion for ideas-driven design: crafting experiences with empathy and respect for human behaviour. Affecting lives for the better.

I’ll be graduating in June this year, and am seeking internships with start-ups and digital agencies in London or San Francisco.

If you’ve any oppurtunities or advice, or just want to chat, I’d love to hear from you.

## Experience
[See my résumé](/resume.pdf) for a more comprehensive list.

#### Placement at [ASHA](http://ashawebsite.co.uk/), a branding agency (August–September 2015)
Actively contributed to naming, brand strategy and logo development in the lead up to first-stage client presentation for ChangeGrowLive. Designed a custom icon set for use in environmental graphics and branding material. Work placement extended at request of ASHA.

#### [OgilvyChange](http://ogilvychange.com/) Summer School (August 2015)
[OgilvyChange](http://ogilvychange.com/) are a specialist behaviour-change division of the [Ogilvy & Mather](https://ogilvy.co.uk/) advertising group. I was the only designer to secure a place on their summer school. With a small team of psychology graduates, I presented ideas and behavioural ‘nudges’ to encourage the recycling of clothes in the home and in-store . I designed the presentation which was forwarded to a national charity for potential implementation.

#### Freelance web & graphic designer (2009–present)
- Designed a consistent visual identity for the [SAS Hurley Classic](https://www.facebook.com/SasHurleyClassic/?fref=ts), one of the UK’s largest whitewater kayaking events. Created the logo, posters, programmes, banners, Facebook ads, web graphics, trophies and t-shirts for this international event. 

- Designed, built and maintained Wordpress sites for Jack Beck, Amber Business and Norma Stephenson with documentation for each.

When not working, I’m likely to be surfing, kayaking or exploring the outdoors, and encouraging others to do so. I represented the UK in freestyle kayaking (bronze medallist 2012 European Championships) and am the Head Coach at Falmouth Student Kayak Club.

## About this site

I've built this latest incarnation of my personal site to give a sort of all-under-one-roof summary of me as a designer. It's very much a work in progress, please forgive the rough edges as I tighten things up. :)

It's a static site complied by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and served through [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Mark Otto's [*Poole*](https://github.com/poole/poole) helped get things off the ground. 

This is my first encounter with Jekyll, so far it seems great. Much simpler than working with Wordpress. Liquid, it's templating language, is a doddle to learn too.

I'm keeping an [updated list of issues and things to do here…](https://workflowy.com/s/tOSIWFifHd)

Headings and UI text are rendered in the system font. Body copy in [Freight Text Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro), served via Typekit. [Basehold.it](http://basehold.it/) took the pain out of establishing some vertical rythmn.

Thanks also to all in [Spec.fm's](http://spec.fm/) [Wake team](https://inspect.wake.io/), whose feedback was invaluable in getting the site's design to this point.
