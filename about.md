**I’m Sam Stephenson**, a digital designer and student at Falmouth University. I study graphic design, but have long been fond of the the web and digital products. I have a passion for good, ideas-driven design; crafting experiences with empathy and respect for human behaviour. Affecting lives for the better.

I’ll be graduating in June this year, and am seeking oppurtunities with start-ups and digital agencies in London or San Francisco.

If you’ve enquiries or advice, or just want to chat, I’d love to talk. You’ll find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samstephenson1), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/samstephenson) and [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/user/11120014586), and can [send an email here.](mailto:sam@stephenson.net)

## Experience
[See my résumé](/resume.pdf) for a more comprehensive list.

#### ASHA <small>August–September 2015</small>
[ASHA](http://ashawebsite.co.uk/) are an award-winning graphic design agency based in Cheltenham, in the West of England. During a three-week placement, I actively contributed to naming, brand strategy and logo development in the lead up to the first-stage client presentation for [*ChangeGrowLive*](http://ashawebsite.co.uk/news/asha-launches-rebrand-of-recovery-charity/). I designed a custom icon set for use in environmental graphics and branding material. Placement was extended at the request of ASHA.

#### OgilvyChange <small>August 2015</small>
[OgilvyChange](http://ogilvychange.com/) are a specialist behaviour-change division of the [Ogilvy & Mather](https://ogilvy.co.uk/) advertising group. I was the only designer to secure a place on their summer school. With a small team of psychology graduates, I presented ideas and behavioural ‘nudges’ to encourage the recycling of clothes in the home and in-store . I designed the presentation which was forwarded to a national charity for potential implementation.

#### Freelance designer <small>2009–present</small>
- Designed a consistent visual identity for the [SAS Hurley Classic](https://www.facebook.com/SasHurleyClassic/?fref=ts), one of the UK’s largest whitewater kayaking events. Created the logo, posters, programmes, banners, Facebook ads, web graphics, trophies and t-shirts for this international event. 

- Designed, built and maintained Wordpress sites for Jack Beck, Amber Business and Norma Stephenson with documentation for each.

## Otherwise, probably outside

When not working, I’m likely to be surfing, kayaking or exploring the outdoors, and encouraging others to do so. As a junior, I represented the UK in freestyle kayaking, taking home a bronze medal in the 2012 European Championships.

Last year, I played stuntman in an action sports film for my friend [Al](https://vimeo.com/alpleass), proving design to be to be a more promising career path than acting. You'll [find the film here.](https://vimeo.com/126584802) 

## About this site

I've built this latest incarnation of my personal site to give a sort of all-under-one-roof summary of me as a designer. It's very much a work in progress, please forgive the rough edges as I tighten things up. :)

It's a static site complied by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and served through [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Mark Otto's [*Poole*](https://github.com/poole/poole) helped get things off the ground. 

This is my first encounter with Jekyll, so far it seems great. Much simpler than working with Wordpress. Liquid, it's templating language, is a doddle to learn too.

I'm keeping an [updated list of issues and things to do here…](https://workflowy.com/s/tOSIWFifHd)

Headings and UI text are rendered in the system font. Body copy in [Freight Text Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro), served via Typekit.
