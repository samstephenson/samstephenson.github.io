Amber Business is a small business consultancy and financial directors based in the South West of England. They asked for a new website to better communicate what they do to prospective customers, and to drive new enquiries. 

Together with Michael, the owner, we decided on a design which talks the user through his proposition. Communicating the value he could provide whilst retaining a healthy dose of his personality.

With the design decided, I built the site on top of an existing single-page Wordpress theme, heavily customised to fit the design.
