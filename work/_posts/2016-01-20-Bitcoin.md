Bitcoin is a new way of doing money – and as a currency it is slowly maturing. But fundamentally it is a system born in the gloomy world of hacker forums, built on complex cryptography beyond the comprehension of most ordinary folk.

To achieve mainstream success, Bitcoin must learn to speak human, make itself accessible and useful to ordinary people and grow up and out from its hacker roots. Once it does, it has the potential to revolutionise the world of finance and affect the lives of billions.

### Who will benefit most?

Here in the developed world, over 95% of us own a bank account, and are comfortable with that. For us, I’m not yet sure there’s a compelling case for adopting Bitcoin. In the developing world however, it’s a different story. Around 50% of the world doesn’t have a bank account – for them Bitcoin could actually be an opportunity – to leapfrog the West and lead the world with the future of currency.

### Money & poverty
In 2015, nearly half the world’s population still lives below the poverty line on less than $2.50 a day. In this environment economies are mostly cash-based and informal. There is no accountability, allowing exploitation of the poor to run rife whilst governments and financial powers are corrupt. This all serves to create an unstable national currency and starves the poorest of the resources they need.

Bitcoin can help solve this. Its democratic and decentralised nature unties people from corruption and can help them take control of their finances. Money becomes a tool for self-improvement, not a weight to shackle you down.

### Values

- **Safe**: Bitcoin stays with you; wherever you and your phone may go. Your money is locked down so only you may access it.
- **Reliable**: Free from the influence of corruption and unstable cash economies, Bitcoin is a reliable foundation to put your faith in and build a future from.
- **Accessible**:
With no barrier to entry the system is simple and user friendly. The network of CoinAgents means it’s never far to withdraw and deposit cash.
- **Democratic**:
As a decentralised currency, the future of Bitcoin is dictated by the people that use it – an entire government holds no more influence than any individual.
- **Empowering**:
Bitcoin’s technology opens up possibilities impossible for a cash economy. With Bitcoin, there are no horizons – it operates on an international scale not bound by borders or city limits.
- **Human**:
Bitcoin transactions are person to person – it’s just you, and the one receiving your money, with no faceless organisation lurking in between.


## Bitcoin CoinAgents

To bridge the gap between current cash economies and new digital currency, a network of ‘CoinAgents’ would allow people to easily exchange their cash for Bitcoin. Customers simply hand over cash and receive the equivalent Bitcoin, via SMS or a printed voucher.

### Merchant app
This smartphone app allows CoinAgents to perform and track exchanges quickly and securely.

## Onboarding

To introduce people to the potential of Bitcoin, I designed a leaflet to be handed out at points-of-sale and other touchpoints. The language is crafted to quickly clarify the benefits of digital currency and make signing up as easy as possible. Informal copy, newsprint paper and hand-drawn illustrations give it a helpful, approachable feel.


## Environmental Application
Branding is spread throughout populated areas using everyday objects coloured with the same distinctive yellow. The message and objects are all metaphors for Bitcoin’s key values and all have real uses beyond advertising so they can permeate the environment over time.

Special messages are tailored towards small businesses. The printed mats, for example, serve as a metaphor for people literally building their business upon Bitcoin.
