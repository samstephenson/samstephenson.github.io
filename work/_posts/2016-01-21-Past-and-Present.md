## The Brief
Create an event publication for the Royal Institute of Philosophy's Past & Present series, using the provided lecture transcripts, biographies and quotes. 
The publication should embody the Institute’s message, ‘philosophy for everyone’, making the subject accessible and engaging to a wide audience beyond academia.

## Solution
*Capture the spirit of a live event*

The content provided is a series of lecture transcripts. I wanted to encapsulate the experience of those live lectures within the design of the publication – making readers feel as if they were in the room with the speaker, reliving the event for themselves.

### Craft
The book is printed in a single, rich cobalt ink, designed to feel prestigious and envelope the reader in the words of the lecturers. The type is set in Baskerville and Akzidenz Grotesk – a juxtaposition of old England and new modernism to reflect the Past & Present theme.

Publication is split into two sections: lecture transcripts and biographies – signified by a change in paper stock.
