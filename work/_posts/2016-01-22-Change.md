95% of our decisions happen without conscious awareness – split-second, impulsive and easily influenced.

*Thinking Inside a Box* puts scientific understanding of these influences into practice. It's an idea-generation tool; use it to change the behaviour of your customers, users, audience, friends, parents or children.
